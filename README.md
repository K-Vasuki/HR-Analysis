#  HR Attrition Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis project using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python** to explore and visualize employee attrition trends from the IBM HR Analytics dataset.

---

##  Project Objective

To identify patterns and key drivers of employee attrition using historical HR data, enabling data-driven decisions to improve retention strategies.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** â€“ Data querying, grouping, filtering
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboards, KPIs, slicers, and visuals
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **DAX** â€“ Measures for calculated fields in Power BI

---

## Key Business Questions

- Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition?
- Is OverTime associated with employee attrition?
- How does attrition vary by age, gender, and income?
- Which employee segments are at the highest risk of leaving?

---

##  Dataset

- **Source**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset  
- **Records**: 1,470 employees  
- **Attributes**: Age, Job Role, Department, Gender, Monthly Income, OverTime, Attrition, and more

---

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- **KPI Cards**: Total Employees, Attrition Count, Avg Monthly Income
- **Bar Charts**: Attrition by Department, Age Group, and Job Role
- **Pie Chart**: OverTime vs Attrition
- **Clustered Charts**: Gender-wise Attrition
- **Slicers**: Filter by Gender, Age Group, Salary Band, and Department

## Python EDA Insights
Created correlation plots to identify key influencing features

Analyzed distribution of MonthlyIncome and Age for attrited employees

Found significant links between OverTime and Attrition

## Key Insights
Majority attrition occurs among employees aged <40

R&D and Sales departments have the highest turnover

OverTime is highly correlated with attrition (46% attrited worked overtime)

Women showed a slightly higher attrition rate than men

Entry-level roles (Sales Executive, Lab Technician) had the most exits

## Recommendations
Focus retention efforts on <40 age group and junior roles

Reduce OverTime workload in high-risk departments

Improve engagement and growth plans for women

Offer career development paths in Sales and R&D
